[Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read it before
engaging in issues, discussions, or pull requests. Report unacceptable
behavior to **legal@nudgebee.com**.

## Ways to Contribute

- **Report a bug** — open a GitHub issue using the bug template.
- **Request a feature** — open a GitHub issue using the feature
  template and describe the use case.
- **Improve documentation** — typo fixes, clarifications, and new
  guides are always welcome.
- **Submit code** — see the workflow below.

## Project Layout

Nudgebee is a monorepo of 16 services (Go, Python, TypeScript)
deployed on Kubernetes. See [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) for a full
service map and per-service build commands. Each service has its own
`Makefile` (where applicable) and CI workflow under
`.github/workflows/`.

## Development Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository and create a feature branch from `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/short-description
   ```

   Branch naming: `feat/...`, `fix/...`, `docs/...`, `refactor/...`,
   `chore/...`.

2. **Make your changes.** Keep the change focused — avoid mixing
   unrelated refactors into a feature PR.

3. **Validate locally before pushing.** Each service has its own
   validation command. The most common ones:

   | Service type                    | Command                                             |
   | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
   | Go service with Makefile        | `make validate`                                     |
   | Python service with Makefile    | `make lint && make test`                            |
   | Python service without Makefile | `poetry run black --check . && poetry run flake8 .` |
   | TypeScript frontend (`app/`)    | `npm run lint2 && npm run test`                     |

   See [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) for the full per-service table.

4. **Write tests.** Bug fixes should include a regression test;
   features should include unit tests at minimum.

5. **Commit** using the Conventional Commits format:

   ```
   <type>(<scope>): <short description>
   ```

   - **type**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`,
     `test`, `chore`, `revert`, `ci`, `infra`, `release`
   - **scope** (optional): `autopilot`, `workflow`, `ml`, `llm`,
     `notifications`, `ui`, `tickets`, `relay`, `collector`, `deps`,
     etc.

   Examples:

   ```
   fix(llm): handle null pointer in config loader
   feat(ui): add user settings page
   docs: clarify local validation steps
   ```

6. **Open a pull request** against `main`. CI will run the relevant
   service's lint, type check, and test suite automatically.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- **Link an issue.** PRs targeting `main` should reference a GitHub
  issue (`Fixes #<n>` or `Refs #<n>`). If no issue exists for what
  you're working on, open one first so the change can be discussed
  before code review.
- **Keep PRs small.** Aim for under ~400 lines of diff where
  possible. Split larger work into a series of PRs.
- **Fill in the PR template.** Describe the change, link to the
  issue, and check the applicable "type of change" boxes.
- **All CI checks must pass** before review.
- **Be responsive to review feedback.** Push fixups as new commits;
  we'll squash on merge.

## Branch Model

- The `main` branch is the development branch that all
  contributions target.
- Open your pull request against `main`.
- Maintainers handle releases and any downstream branches; you do
  not need to target them in your PR.

## Local Development Setup

Each service ships a `.env.example`. The flow is the same for every
service: bring up the shared infrastructure once with Docker Compose,
copy the `.env.example` to `.env` for each service you intend to run,
edit only what you need, then run that service from source.

### 1. Bring up shared infrastructure

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres rabbitmq redis qdrant temporal
```

You rarely need all 20+ compose services running at once — see the
"Common minimal stacks" table in the root [README](./README.md) for
typical combinations.

### 2. Configure per-service environment

```bash
# Example: services-server
cp api-server/services/.env.example api-server/services/.env
# Edit values as needed
$EDITOR api-server/services/.env
```

Repeat for every service you plan to run from source. The bundled
`.env.example` files document every variable inline; you usually only
need to set the ones that differ from the defaults.

### 3. Run servers from source

Each service has a `make run` (or `npm run dev` / `poetry run …`)
target — see the per-service `README.md` for specifics. Start the
frontend last, after the backends it depends on are healthy.

### Cross-service env vars that MUST match

A few values are shared across services and must be **identical** in
every `.env` of every running service — otherwise services fail to
authenticate or to decrypt each other's data.

| Variable                  | Where it must match                                                           |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NUDGEBEE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | `app`, `api-server/services`, anywhere that reads `integration_config_values` |
| `ACTION_API_SERVER_TOKEN` | `app` ↔ `api-server/services`, `notifications-server`, `ticket-server`, …     |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`         | `app` only, but must be stable across restarts                                |

If you rotate one of these in one service and forget to update the others, the symptom is usually a `401 Unauthorized` on RPC calls between services, or an `Invalid IV` / decryption failure when reading stored integration credentials.

### Troubleshooting

**`fetch failed` on RPC calls between services.** Usually one of the upstream services isn't running or isn't reachable from the caller. Check `RELAY_SERVER_ENDPOINT`, `SERVICE_API_SERVER_URL`, `LLM_SERVER_URL`, etc. in the caller's `.env` — they default to in-cluster service-discovery names that won't resolve outside Kubernetes.

**Postgres `connection refused`.** The compose service is named `postgres` (resolves inside the compose network) but if you're running a service from source on the host, it should point at `localhost:5432`. Check the `APP_DATABASE_URL` host name.

**RabbitMQ messages stuck in the queue.** The consumer for that queue isn't running. Each service's `README.md` lists which queues it consumes. Check `docker logs rabbitmq` or visit the management UI at `http://localhost:15672` (user/pass: `guest`/`guest`).

**Frontend says "Invalid IV" / decryption errors when reading integrations.** `NUDGEBEE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` mismatch between the service that wrote the row and the service reading it. Make sure every `.env` you're running has the same value.

**`npm install` fails with peer-dependency errors.** Use `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` in the `app/` directory — required by some legacy MUI v4 / React Hook Form combinations.

**`npm run lint2` fails on `[warn] README.md` (prettier).** You added a markdown table whose column widths don't match prettier's auto-formatting. Run `cd app && npx prettier@2.8.8 --write ../README.md` (or `npx prettier --write README.md` from the repo root) and re-commit. CI uses prettier v2, so pin the version when running from `app/`.

**Build OOM on `npm run build`.** Set `NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=4096` before running. The CI workflow does this automatically; local builds need it manually for large branches.

**Go module errors / `cannot find module`.** Run `go mod download` then `go mod tidy` in the service directory. If you see private-module errors, the monorepo is fully public — there are no private dependencies, so an error here usually means a corrupted module cache (`go clean -modcache` to nuke and re-fetch).

**Python `mypy` errors after pulling main.** Stale `.mypy_cache/`. Remove it recursively: `find . -name ".mypy_cache" -type d -exec rm -rf {} +`. The `make clean` target in each Python service also does this for that service.

If none of the above match, search the issue tracker — many setup issues have prior threads. Still stuck? Reach out to the contacts on the [new-issue page](https://github.com/nudgebee/nudgebee/issues/new).
