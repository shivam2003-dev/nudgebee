# Reconciliation — catch up test rows to server-side conversation status
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The test row's ``status`` can drift from the llm-server conversation status
# in a handful of ways (all observed in production):
#   - llm-server resumed a parent via internal bubble-up and flipped the
#     conversation to COMPLETED, but the benchmark's poll has not yet
#     returned so the test row still says ``waiting``.
#   - A followup submission succeeded at the llm-server, but the controller's
#     background task crashed/restarted before persisting the final answer.
#   - A server restart cleared ``waiting`` without knowing that the
#     conversation had already moved on.
# ``reconcile_waiting_tests`` closes that gap by doing a one-shot read of
# each waiting test's conversation and transitioning the test row if the
# server considers the work done. It's safe to call from multiple places
# (complete_run gate, orphan recovery, periodic sweep) — it's idempotent.

    reconciles and quarantines genuinely-orphaned RUNNING/PAUSED runs;
    this one finalizes runs whose tests are all terminal but whose
    own state never got flipped to COMPLETED.

    Race we're fixing: when a followup completes via the controller's
    ``_run_followup_task`` (last in a benchmark), the controller intentionally
    skips ``finish_single_test`` (see comment at line ~1957 in
    agent_benchmark_controller.py) so it doesn't race with the orchestrator's
    main loop. But that main loop already returned — nobody finalizes. Result:
    state=running, all tests pass, ``completed_at`` NULL, ``report_json`` NULL.
    Reproduced in d994a999a361 and 312491b55ab9.

    Sweeper criteria for "stuck":
      - state=RUNNING
      - updated_at older than ``stale_minutes``
      - 0 tests in pending/waiting/running (everything is terminal)
      - progress_total > 0 (don't finalize a run that never started)

    For each match, calls ``complete_run`` which assembles the report and
    transitions the row to COMPLETED. Errors are logged and the loop
    continues so a single bad row doesn't block recovery of others.

    Returns the number of runs recovered. Safe to call from any read endpoint.

    Why this exists: the standard ``create_run`` → orchestrator path inserts
    a ``BenchmarkTestResult`` row only when a worker thread actually starts
    a test (via ``execute_single_test`` → ``store_test_result``). With N
    parallel workers and >N tests, the overflow sits in the
    ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` queue without any DB row. During the brief window
    where the first batch's rows have just flipped to ``pass``/``fail`` but
    queued tests have not yet been dequeued, every "row count vs. planned
    total" predicate in this module sees an under-count and concludes the
    run is done — flipping it to COMPLETED/FAILED and causing
    ``should_proceed`` to return False for the queued workers when they
    finally start, which aborts those tests with no row ever written.

    Pre-inserting ``pending`` rows closes the gap: every gate
    (``_run_has_all_terminal_tests``, ``recover_orphaned_runs``'s
    per-run non-terminal probe, ``finish_single_test``'s pending count,
    ``complete_run``'s planned-total check) sees N rows from the moment the
    orchestrator commits its plan, so no transient under-count is possible.

    Idempotent: if a row already exists for a given ``test_index`` (e.g.
    rerun-tests path that reset specific rows to ``running``, or partial
    state from a crashed mid-run), it is left untouched.

    Args:
        run_id: Benchmark run identifier.
        test_cases: List of test-case dicts from
            ``orchestrator.discover_test_cases``. Each must carry
            ``__id__`` and ``__global_index__`` (set by the discoverer);
            ``user_prompt``, ``expected_output``, ``tags`` are also
            harvested if present.

        The number of rows actually inserted (0 if all rows already exist).
